1. first we check if the age is greater than (-gt) or equal to (-eq) 18. if so, we allow the person to go to the party. of not, then we need to check if he/she has a permission letter (yes/no). if so, they can go to the party and be back before midnight. if not, they're not allowed to go to the party.

2. we use mkdir to make directories. we can make several directories by using mkdir Name{first..last}.

3. we can search for files by using 'find' command. 
by using -type, we target the file type.
by using * , we target all the files with any name.
we can use 'for' command to make a loop in order to change the name of all of desired files.
as we want to start from img1... , we set a counter variable and increase it everytime we name a file.
